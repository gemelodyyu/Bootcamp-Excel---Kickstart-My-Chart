# Kickstart Analysis 

## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

## Analysis Report

### Conclusions 

1. Out of the 9 categories, “Theater” has the largest number of total projects (n = 1393). It also has the largest number of successful projects (n = 839). The category that has the highest successful rate is “Music” (77.14%), followed by “Theater” (60.23%) and “Film & Video” (57.69%). Thereby, current data suggests that projects in these categories are more likely to be successful comparing with other categories. However, “Theater” category also has the largest number of failed projects (n = 493). It also should be noted that “Technology” has the largest number and rate of canceled project (178 out of 600). It is hard to find out a reason without more details about the projects, so hope there will be additional information provided for a more in-depth analysis.
